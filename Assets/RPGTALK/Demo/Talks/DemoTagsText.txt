FunnyGuy: Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't seen you there. What can I help you?
*PlayerName*: I'm here to learn about tags in RPGTalk!
FunnyGuy: Well you have already used one! Using the <b>dub</b> tag, you can make a sound! Thanks to the [sprite=0] RPGTalkDubSounds Component.
*PlayerName*: [dub=1]Cof, Cof... \n Wow! It is true! And I just breaked a line!
FunnyGuy: Also, Rich text is fully supported now. You can make anything <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, change text <size=30>Size</size> or even its <color=red>color</color>
*PlayerName*: <b><i><color=blue>NICE</color></i></b>
FunnyGuy: You can now change text speed during the text, so I can tell you something with quite an [speed=5]impact. [/speed] Looks important, right?
*PlayerName*: Yes! [sprite=1] RPGTalk is getting really amazing! Wait... Did i just used [speed=5]sprites[/speed] inside the text?
FunnyGuy: Sure! You can have an image occupying space inside the text using the <b>sprite</b> tag. Really cool.
FunnyGuy: Useful to show tutorial like "press [sprite=2]" or "get [sprite=3] to continue".
*PlayerName*: Really cool! And that balloon above our heads... It is changed by script?
FunnyGuy: Not at all! RPGTalk uses our names to define who the canvas should follow!
*PlayerName*: AWESOME! It would only be better if I could make choices or change the language...
FunnyGuy: Well... Why don't you talk to the girl on the other room?
*PlayerName*: You are joking?!?
FunnyGuy: [dub=0]hum hum hummm... hum hum humm... hum hum huhum hum hummmm...

*PlayerName*: So... I heard you can tell more about Choices or Languages?
Girl: Of course! You can now change language easily using  [sprite=0] RPGTalkLocalization.
