Two months ago, I had a run-in with a spirit that left me shaken to my core. 
I had always been skeptical of the supernatural, but that experience left me with no doubt that spirits were real. 
I still remember the cold, otherworldly feeling of the ghostly figure as it stood before me, its eyes fixed on mine. 
I don't know how long I stood there, frozen in fear, but eventually a spirit specialist appeared and chased the spirit away.

I was deeply grateful to the spirit specialist for saving me, and I couldn't help but be fascinated by their knowledge and expertise when it came to dealing with the supernatural. 
So when they offered me the opportunity to assist them in their work, I jumped at the chance.

I learned that the spirit specialist was responsible for protecting a certain property in the countryside, and that I would be helping them to maintain and safeguard it. 
I had no idea what to expect as I set out for the property, but I was determined to do my best and prove myself as a valuable member of the team.

As I arrived at the mysterious property, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement mixed with trepidation. 
I knew that I was about to embark on a journey that would challenge me in ways I couldn't even imagine. 
But I was ready for it, and I was determined to do everything I could to help this person in their duty.
